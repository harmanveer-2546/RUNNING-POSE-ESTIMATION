# RUNNING POSE ESTIMATION

Pose estimation is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field within computer vision that aims to predict and track the location and orientation of a person or object in images or videos. It essentially involves understanding the posture or configuration of a subject based on visual data. It represents the orientation of a person in a graphical format. This technique is widely applied to predict a personâ€™s body parts or joint position. It is one of the most exciting areas of research in computer vision that has gained a lot of traction because of its abundance of applications that can benefit from such a technology. 

Running Pose Estimation involves detecting and tracking the key landmarks or points on a person's body in an image or video. These landmarks typically represent joints, such as shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. The goal of pose estimation is to understand and analyze the body's pose, movements, and gestures, which can be valuable for various applications, including human-computer interaction, sports analysis, fitness tracking, and more.
One popular library for implementing pose estimation is mediapipe, developed by Google. It provides a pre-built Pose module that makes it easy to integrate pose estimation into your Python applications.

Pose estimation has a wide range of applications, impacting various sectors like:

* Healthcare: Analyzing movement patterns for rehabilitation, injury prevention, and gait analysis.
* Fitness: Providing feedback on exercise form and technique.
* Entertainment: Creating realistic animations and video game characters.
* Security: Detecting suspicious activity in surveillance footage.
* Augmented Reality: Superimposing digital objects onto the real world spatially accurately.
